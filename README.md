### Project History
Our team developed this project for ENGCMP 0600 INTRO TO TECHNICAL WRITING (Fall 2021) at the University of Pittsburgh with the goal of providing resources to fellow students about sustainable development. The manual features 5 sections: 
* What is Sustainability?
* Cities of the Future
* Ethics
* Why should you care?
* Studying Sustainability at Pitt

We decided to show the navigation panel to the left at all times so users can choose to look at the modules in order or jump around. Making all of the resources easily accessable helps achieve our goal of exposing students to the basics of sustainability. The last module includes resources for studying sustainability at the University of Pittsburgh, including the Mascaro Cetner, the sustainability certificate, and sustainability-focused courses.
