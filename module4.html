1. If you haven't worked through one of our Open Fuego introductory assignmnets (Electrate Fuego or I-Am-A-Project-In-Becoming), please do so. It will give you the basic skills to use this tool. 
2. File Management. Keep your asset names simple and one word. 
3. Make sure your assets names/file type match your code.
4. Describe all images for accesibility purposes.
5. Consult W3 when our code is not working for you. 
6. Control Z, Control Z, Control Z
7. Publish, share, spread the Fuego!-->
